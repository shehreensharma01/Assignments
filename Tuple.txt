Create a tuple named product containing the following items: "Laptop", 50000, Black ,'Samsung' and "Electronics". Print the tuple.

product = ("Laptop", 50000, "Black", "Samsung", "Electronics")
print("Product Tuple:", product)

Access and print the second element of the tuple product.
print("Second Element:", product[1])

Slice and print the last two elements of the product tuple.
print("Last Two Elements:", product[-2:])

Check whether "Electronics" is present in the product tuple and print a message.
if "Electronics" in product:
    print("Yes, 'Electronics' is present in the product tuple.")
else:
    print("No, 'Electronics' is not present in the product tuple.")

Create a tuple of 5 product prices: (1000, 1500, 1200, 1100, 900). Count how many times 1000 appears.
prices = (1000, 1500, 1200, 1100, 900)
print("Count of 1000 in prices:", prices.count(1000))

Find and print the maximum and minimum price from the prices tuple.
print("Maximum Price:", max(prices))
print("Minimum Price:", min(prices))

Use a loop to print each item from the product tuple on a new line.
print("Items in product tuple:")
for item in product:
    print(item)


Convert the product tuple to a list. Change the price to 55000, then convert it back to a tuple. Print the updated tuple.
product_list = list(product)
product_list[1] = 55000
product = tuple(product_list)
print("Updated Product Tuple:", product)

Add a new item "In Stock" to the product tuple (simulate adding by concatenation).
product = product + ("In Stock",)
print("Final Product Tuple:", product)

Remove "Electronics" from the product tuple (by converting to list, removing, and converting back).
product_list = list(product)
product_list.remove("Electronics")
product = tuple(product_list)
print("Product Tuple after removing 'Electronics':", product)

Unpack the tuple product into three variables and print each variable.
product_simple = ("Laptop", 55000, "Samsung")
name, price, brand = product_simple
print("Name:", name)
print("Price:", price)
print("Brand:", brand)

Create a nested tuple that contains three product tuples inside it. Access and print the name of the second product in the nested tuple.
nested_products = (
    ("Laptop", 55000, "Samsung"),
    ("Mobile", 30000, "Apple"),
    ("Tablet", 20000, "Lenovo")
)

print("Second Product Name:", nested_products[1][0])
